# ❤️ Predict Heart Disease

## 📌 Overview
The Predict Heart Disease project uses Machine Learning to predict whether a person is at risk of heart disease based on medical health data.  
This system analyzes key health metrics such as age, cholesterol level, blood pressure, and maximum heart rate to classify whether a patient is likely to have heart disease or not.  
Users can run the model locally using a Python script or notebook for medical risk analysis.

## 🚀 Features
- Predict heart disease risk using health measurements
- Uses supervised Machine Learning classification
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Fast and efficient predictions
- Easy to run locally in a Jupyter Notebook or Python script
- Demonstrates real-world health prediction application

---

## 🧠 Machine Learning Workflow
- Load the Heart Disease dataset (e.g., UCI Heart Disease Dataset)  
- Clean and preprocess raw medical data  
- Handle missing values and scale features if necessary  
- Split dataset into training and testing sets  
- Train a classification model (e.g., Logistic Regression / Random Forest)  
- Evaluate model performance using accuracy and other metrics  
- Predict outcomes for new health data inputs

## 🧪 Sample Output
- Input: Age: 55, Cholesterol: 250, Max Heart Rate: 150  
  Output: **Heart Disease Risk: Yes**

- Input: Age: 42, Cholesterol: 180, Max Heart Rate: 170  
  Output: **Heart Disease Risk: No**
